= DebsFromRepos - Debian packages availables at a spcific repository

== Description

This is a small lib to get the names and descriptions for the availables
packages at specific (or group of them) Debian/Ubuntu repository.

== Installation


  (sudo) gem install debsfromrepos


== Usage

You have a example of how the library works at the <tt>examples/</tt> directory:

  examples/repo2json.rb

Basicaly you require the lib

  require 'debsfromrepos'

and ask for the right <tt>Packages.gz</tt> url for a specific Debian/Ubuntu server

  server = "http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu"
  suite = "oneiric"
  component = "main"
  repository = DebsFromRepos::ListUrl.new(server, suite, component)
  repository.get_url
  # => "http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/binary-i386/Packages.gz"

you also can change the <tt>suite</tt> or <tt>component</tt>

  repository.component = 'universe'
  # => "http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/universe/binary-i386/Packages.gz"

and then get all the packages' names and descriptions on that component of
that suite of that repository:

  pkgs = DebsFromRepos::Packages.new(repositories)
  pkgs.packages['2ping']
  # => "Ping utility to determine directional packet loss"
